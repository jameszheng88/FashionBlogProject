    <p>Just like all good things in life – cheese and wine, for example – we believe fashion sense only improves with
      age. If you’ve been scrolling Instagram and chasing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ootd/?hl=en"
        style="color:darkgoldenrod"><em>Outfit of the Day</em></a> posts but nothing quite seems
      to be
      clicking anymore, you may have matured beyond the fashion influencers you’re currently following.</p>

      seasoned fashionistas… probably not unlike you! Here are ten influencers in their 30s who are sure to be your next
      style guru.</p>
